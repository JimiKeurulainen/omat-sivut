<h1 class="western">This website</h1>
<h2 class="western">Project objectives</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Barlow, sans-serif"><font size="3">The aim of this website is to serve as my portfolio and possibly as a blog. In addition to my own information, the website will show projects I have done in various areas, at least initially in programming and 3D modelling. The aim is also to show the 3D models I have made on the site in an interactive way.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br />
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Barlow, sans-serif"><font size="3">I aim to make this website easy to edit and update. Since much of the content of the website will be text, I want an easy way to edit it. I'm mostly used to using Microsoft Word to write long text documents, so using it for this project would be an easy way to have a strong text editor for creating the texts on the website.
However, I no longer have a license for MS Office after graduating from the AMK, so the alternative will be Apache Open Office. Both programs have the ability to export documents in HTML format, which should work just fine for embedding text. This way I can also edit the styling of the text itself directly with CSS if necessary.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br />
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Barlow, sans-serif"><font size="3">I also aim to learn new technologies and hone existing skills during this project. For example, I'm thinking of developing the project in React instead of JavaScript with TypeScript for stronger typing and security. I will also explore different NPM packages to create a more polished look and feel and animations.</font></font></p>
<h2 class="western">Project design</h2>
<p class="western">The structure of the website will consist of two main elements: a top section and a bottom section. The upper part will be the homepage, where you will see various works of mine in the form of 3D models, images and videos. The bottom part will consist mostly of text, and will be divided (at least initially) into three categories: about me, my project and my channel. 
</p>
<p class="western">Between the top and bottom sections will be a navigation bar, where buttons will allow you to navigate between the two sections and the categories in the bottom section. The web page itself will be twice as high as the browser interface, and the navigation between the top and bottom sections will be animated scrolling. The user will be able to move to the bottom by pressing a category button, and back to the top by pressing the active category button again.
The categories in the lower part will also be inside a scrollable container, but will be scrolled horizontally.</p>
<p class="western">The structure of the website is based on my previous websites, so I didn't have to come up with a new structure. I decided to come up with a more refined visual look during development, and I ended up styling most of the elements to look a bit like thin sheets lit from above. The general shape and theme of the styling was rounded edges, thin and sharp lines, sliding colours and strong contrast. 
</p>
<h2 class="western">Project technologies</h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Barlow, sans-serif"><font size="3">I'm going to develop the website with the MEAN stack, by the way, except I won't need a database, or at least not yet. Listed below are the technologies I use:</font></font></p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Barlow, sans-serif"><font size="3">React with Typescript</font></font></p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Barlow, sans-serif"><font size="3">The most essential React npm packages I use:</font></font></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Barlow, sans-serif"><font size="3">React-three, React-three-fiber and React-three-three</font></font></p>

	</li></ul>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Barlow, sans-serif"><font size="3">Node.js</font></font></p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Barlow, sans-serif"><font size="3">Express.js</font></font></p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><font face="Barlow, sans-serif"><font size="3">Apache2</font></font></p>
</li></ul>
<h2 class="western">The course of the project</h2>
<p class="western">You can follow the progress of the project from the code side on <a href="https://github.com/JimiKeurulainen/omat-sivut">my GitHub.</a></p>
<p class="western">At the beginning of the project, I created a React project for my own website and put it online.
I decided to put a rudimentary React project online, because I find it more meaningful to develop when I can quickly release a new representation and more quickly resolve any issues between the development and release versions.</p>
<p class="western">The website is hosted on a server owned by a friend of mine, on which I have also developed his company's website. Since this server already has the necessary background software installed, I only needed to add a new process to the existing ones. The web server is the same Apache2 server as my friend's site, but with a different routing and port. The background of the website is Node.js and Express.js, which stays on the server as a pm2 process.</p>
<p class="western">I got the domain name from NameCheap, and used Let's Encryption to create the SSL certificate. With Let's Encrypt's good instructions, it was easy to generate the certificate and automatically renew it on the server.</p>
<p class="western">Once I had the website online, I started the actual development of the website. The first thing I decided to develop was the navigation bar in the middle of the site. The main purpose of the buttons on the navigation bar is to change only the "activeComponent" state and the "pos" state of the component. "activeComponent" specifies the scroll position of the bottom of the site, and "pos" specifies the position between the top and bottom.</p>
<p class="western">Initially, I used only the container ID of the navigation buttons and React's own "scrollToView" function to implement navigation. This was a workable solution otherwise, but I couldn't adjust the animation of these scrolls. Thus, synchronizing the animations of the navigation bar between scrolling sections of the webpage was awkward. I decided to use the npm package "react-scroll" in place of scrollToView, which allows to separately define the scroll duration and the animation curve. 
</p>
<p class="western">Once I had completed the styling of the navigation bar, I created a styling for the category elements at the bottom. I used a grid container as a "displacer" for each category, and divided this container into a menu element on the left side and a text element in the middle.</p>
<p class="western">Once I had the bottom part styled, I went on to configure the background of the application. I made api calls to the node.js background and decided on the data structure for the project content. I placed all the project content in the "content" folder in the same project root folder as the "client" and "server" folders on the webpage. I thought that the structure of the "content" folder should also function as part of the content, i.e. for example the folder names would be visible on the web page categories displayed on the web page, the folders inside them would act as subcategories, and finally there would be HTML files inside them that would act as text files on the web page.
As a result, the main content of the entire web page would be generated through api calls rather than hard-coded. 
</p>
<p class="western">The first Node.js api function I made here reads the structure of the "content" folder with the readDirSync function and returns this structure as a JavaScript object. After receiving this creature, the application front-end generates the necessary buttons for the navbar element and creates the various category components.</p>
<p class="western">However, I modified the function of the frontend to make the navigation of the site URL-based. This would allow the user to navigate the page using only the web address, and scrolling the page to the correct elements could also happen when reloading the page.</p>
<p class="western">Once I had the bottom part working and looking the way I had intended, I decided to move on to developing the top part of the site. (continued)</p>
